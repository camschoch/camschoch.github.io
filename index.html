			I was born in Nebraska and moved out east to Virginia Beach when I was five years old and thatâ€™s where I spent my childhood growing up. I currently reside in Racine with my oldest brother Brandon and his wife Anji. Currently I am 17 years old and have my hand in multiple hobbies ranging between attempting to skateboard, video gaming, and playing with whatever technology I can get my hands on.

			My future goals both in this course and career wise is to learn how to problem solve and think efficiently in my work. I enjoy going through complex problems and finding solutions to the things that feel unsolvable and that is why I enjoy coding. I look forward to facing the upcoming challenges that will come with the job and lifestyle of being a developer.
