			I was born in Omaha Nebraska and moved out east to Virginia Beach when I was five years old and thatâ€™s where I spent my childhood growing up. I currently reside in Racine Wisconsin practicing my trade of being a computer developer in Milwaukee at devCodeCamp. I am both a high school graduate as well as a graduate of devCodeCamp and am looking for employment as a software developer.

			 I enjoy facing problems and challenges and working through them to find the most efficient solution. My goals for the future is to continue expanding my knowledge and problem-solving abilities. I look forward to being in a place of work that will promote my growth as a developer and will continue to provide opportunity to better both myself and the others around me.
