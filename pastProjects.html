			I have worked on a multitude of projects in various ways and forms of technology in the past ranking anywhere from robotics, CNC plasma cutting, teensy, and more. In the robotics category, I have built and played with RC quite extensively from cars to helicopters and even making a beach cruiser by using electric wheelchair motors on a custom-built metal frame. A majority of my robotic experience comes from helping my dad when I was younger in his business he owned where he made CNC plasma cutting tables and sold them. Along with building and putting together the physical frames I dabbled in learning CAD software to design what was cut with the machine.

			The teensy was a pet project of my fathers that I on occasion picked up and tried playing with. Although when it came to the real programming of it I never got much past getting a LED to light up I did learn how to physically wire it to other boards and solder the pins where needed. One project that was especially fun was building the computers used for the CNC machines. With every machine would come a low-end machine in order to run it so I was in charge of building and installing the machines with windows and the needed software. Having done both building physical computers and installing software along with playing with different things along the lines of teensy and robotics I am fairly familiar with technology from multiple catagories.
