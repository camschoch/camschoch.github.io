			I graduated highschool in 2017 which was a year ahead of my class. I made the decision to jump straight into my career by going through a full-immersive coding bootcamp called devCodeCamp. DevCodeCamp is a 12-week, 600 hour coding bootcamp based in Milwaukee, WI. Throughout the 12-weeks, I worked on a number of projects using multiple languages and techniques from JavaScript to C# console apps, both database first using SQL, code first applications, Object Oriented Programming (OOP), and Test Driven Development (TDD). From there C# ASP.Net MVC, RESTful APIs, as well as this very page using HTML 5 and CSS. I wrapped up the program in October 2017.

			Prior to devCodeCamp I worked as a Barista at Starbucks for seven months until the start of the program. At that point, I felt it was important to focus on gaining a solid foundation while learning to code, so I put Starbucks on hold. Upon graduation, while finding the right fit as a Junior Developer I am working on side start-up projects to further build my experience and familiarity with code and life as a Developer.
