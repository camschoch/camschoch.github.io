			I am fresh out of high school having graduated in the spring of 2017 a year ahead of my class. I had attended a public high school North Carolina called Currituck County High School for my first two years of high school. For my third and fourth year I did online classes through Penn Foster and could combine the two years to graduate early. I am now attending devCodeCamp in place of going to a traditional four year secondary education due to the fact I like to be as efficient as possible with my time and resources and I believe this is the best path for that.

			I have worked two main jobs in my life the first one being Dickeys BBQ and the second as a barista at Starbucks. Dickeys was my first official job and I was promoted to assistant manager in charge of closing the store, cleaning, preparing food, and serving customers depending on needs of that day. I worked for Dickeys around three months then I got hired as a barista at Starbucks. My career at Starbucks was about seven months and I just did the regular barista tasks such as making drinks working register and making sure the store was clean. I left Starbucks in order to attend devCodeCamp full time without the worry of not having time to study and work on prjects at home.
